# Capstan-Drive
A Capstan Drive is a cheap rope-driven speed reducer that has low backlash, low inertia, low noise, and high torque transparency. 
When it comes to building robots a Capstan Drive can be quite beneficial. This test stand has the following features:

-3D printed in PLA

-Weighs 852g

-120Â° rotation

-8.55:1 reduction (quasi-direct drive)

-Helical pattern on both drums for guided unraveling

-Lead screw to tension the rope

-ODrive S1 FOC Controller

-Eagle Power 90KV BLDC Motor
